Goal Tracking 
  The goal tracking subsystem will be complex enough to be an app in its own right.
  Some goals are private some goals are public
  All goals follow the SMART methodology.
    Measurable - A study plan and unit tests of knowledge.
	Each unit of knowledge must have summary notes and unit tests.
	I write either use provided problem sets or generate my own.
	I will usually extend or combine problem sets.
        Each unit test will have a question/ problem statement and answer.
	The answer will be the worked problem and possibly a set of input/output test cases.

	Goal
	

git is just a version control system.
Do I want to use Gist for markup and embedded code?
